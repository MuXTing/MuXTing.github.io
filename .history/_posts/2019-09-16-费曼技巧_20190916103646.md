## In English
Step 1  
Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank piece of paper.

Step 2  
Write down an explanation of the concept on the page. Use plain English. Pretend you are teaching it to someone else (e.g a new student). This should highlight what you understand, but more importantly pinpoint what you don't quite know.

Step 3  
Review what you have pinpointed you don't know. Go back to the source material, re-read, and re-learn it. Repeat Step 2.

Step 4  
If you are using overly wordy or confusing language (or simply paraphrasing the source material) try again so you filter the content. Simplify your language, and where possible use simple analogy.

Conclusion
That's it. A simple and powerful technique to ensure you can rapidly learn and retain new concepts and information.
